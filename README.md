## Hi there 👋

# 💫 About Me:
My name is Jan Gwara and I am a Computer Science student enroled in AGH university in Krakow, Poland. I’m interested in Data Science, Web Development and electronics. What is most fascinating to me is how we can cross graphic design and programming, from data visualization to creating beautiful websites which convey what the brand is about. What interests me is how design and visual presentation improves the user experience and our use of technology in everyday life. I am actively searching for new opportunities in tech and I enjoy learning new skills and gaining knowledge everyday. I thrive in creative environment and I like to collaborate with ambitious people. My biggest dream is to one day start my own company and create a meaningful brand creating hardware and software which would improve how we as people interact with technology.

# 🎓 Education
### Highschool (2019 - 2022)
#### Prywatne Akademickie Liceum Ogólnokształcące oddział IB w Krakowie 
I have completed a two year International Baccalaureate diploma program (with a pre-diploma year). Partaking this course gave me an opportunity to pursue my education entirely in English for two years and take subjects normally not available in Poland like economics, business and computer science. 

### University (2022 - Current)
#### University of Science and Technology (AGH-UST)
I am currently pursuing an engineering degree in Computer Science. I have chosen this particular degree because I wanted to discover all corners of this broad subject. Thanks to my choice I am able to learn bits of networking, electronics, programming and even project management.
